tHub Wikis is a simple way to let others contribute content. Any GitHub user can create and edit pages to use for documentation, examples, support, or anything you wish.
Restrict editing to collaborators only 
Public wikis will still be readable by everyone.
Issues 
GitHub Issues adds lightweight issue tracking tightly integrated with your repository. Add issues to milestones, label issues, and close & reference issues from commit messages.
Projects 
Project boards on GitHub help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists.
Merge button
When merging pull requests, you can allow any combination of merge commits, squashing, or rebasing. At least one option must be enabled.

Allow merge commits  
Add all commits from the head branch to the base branch with a merge commit.
Allow squash merging  
Combine all commits from the head branch into a single commit in the base branch.
Allow rebase merging  
Add all commits from the head branch onto the base branch individually.
Temporary interaction limits
Temporarily restrict which users can interact with your repository (comment, open issues, or create pull requests) for a 24-hour period. This may be used to force a "cool-down" period during heated discussions.

Limit to existing users 
Users that have recently created their account will be unable to interact with the repository.
Limit to prior contributors 
Users that have not previously committed to the repository's master branch will be unable to interact with the repository.
Limit to repository collaborators 
Users that have not been granted push access will be unable to interact with the repository.
